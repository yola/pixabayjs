## 0.6.0
* Updated client to match pixabay's new API. ([#33][33])

    * HTTP is no longer supported. However, client was already defaulting to HTTPS.
    * New API keys have been issued. Old API keys will not work after 2/1/2016.
    * Image hash IDs will need to be changed. Use the old hash with the new API key to get the new hash.
